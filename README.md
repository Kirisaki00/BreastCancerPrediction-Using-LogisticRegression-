🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Logistic Regression model training

Model serialization using pickle

Flask web integration

Cloud deployment using Render

The trained model file:

breast_cancer.pkl

📊 Dataset Information

569 samples

30 numerical features

Target variable:

1 → Malignant (Cancerous)

0 → Benign (Not Cancerous)

Preprocessing steps:

Removed id column

Encoded diagnosis (M → 1, B → 0)

Applied StandardScaler for normalization
